title: "combine inclusion tables"
output: html_document

we were having a tough time getting all 42 fastq files aligned in one run, so we split them in 2 sets. This script combines the two inclusion tables since they're too big to do this easily in excel.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
inc1 <-  read_delim("C:/Users/hasna/Documents/MSc_project/vasttools/vast_out_scinet1/INCLUSION_LEVELS_FULL-araTha10-28.tab", delim = "\t")
inc2 <- read_delim("C:/Users/hasna/Documents/MSc_project/vasttools/vast_out_scinet2/INCLUSION_LEVELS_FULL-araTha10-14.tab", delim = "\t")

inc2[, c(1:6)] <- NULL

all_inc <- cbind(inc1, inc2)

#write.table(all_inc, file = "C:/Users/hasna/Documents/MSc_project/vasttools/all_data/complete_inclusion_table.tab", row.names = F, na = "", quote = F, sep = "\t")
```
